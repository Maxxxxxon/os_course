The virtual adress is an adress in the virtual memory, and the physical adress is an adress in the physical memory. 
The difference between virtual and physical memory is that the physical memory is a real memory, while virtual
memory is an abstraction for the program which allows to perform like the program has big memory space (may be 
bigger than the real one), and no other apps use that memory.
