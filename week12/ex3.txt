Results:

First, if we increase size of the file, the time increases (obviously)

Second, if we increase the buffer size, the speed usually increases (whenever O_SYNC included or not)

Third, with O_SYNC the speed of copying in less than without O_SYNC in terms of real spent time,
and they are approximately equal in terms of system spent time. O_SYNC turn off parallelism so the real 
time for O_SYNC is greater, but the amount of work done by processor(s) does not change if we do not 
include O_SYNC, so the system time does not really change.

Fourth, the speed increases linearly as we increase buffer size with O_SYNC ON, and it increases 
logarithmically (approx.) as we increase buffer size with O_SYNC OFF. For quite a big buffer sizes
(for example, equals to the length of file) including O_SYNC does not affect the speed.
