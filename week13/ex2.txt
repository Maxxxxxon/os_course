Recovery:
- It is not always possible to reroll to some checkpoint or to preemt the resource, for some reasons it may be 
bad to kill the process, so dealing with the deadlocks through recovery may have negative consequences
+ Should be used only when the actual problem appears -> much less times, then other methods

Prevention:
- Introduces additional restrictions (sometimes quite strong) for the processes
+ Works and prevents all deadlocks

Avoidance:
- Requires additional data about the process, which is not always provided (so, actually may be not applicable)
+ Works and prevents deadlocks
