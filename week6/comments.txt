On average, SJF algorith significantly outperforms FCFS algorithm both in terms of
average turn around time and average waiting time (actually, these metrics are 
dependent and highly correlated). Futhermore, FCFS algorith significantly outperforms
Round Robin algorithm. again both in terms of average turn around time and average
waiting time. The completion time is always the same for all the three methods.
